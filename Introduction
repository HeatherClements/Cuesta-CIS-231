Cuesta-CIS-231
==============
All programs in this repository were tasks for the CIS 231 class taken at Cuesta for the Fall 2013 semester. Each program has a short explanation in the comment box at the top of the code explaining what the code can accomplish. There is an array of programs within this section, some are assignments and some are labs. Assignments were meant to be longer, more in depth programs and are labeled in the format "231H#hclements" where # is replaced with the assignment number, with the numbers increasing as the semester comes to an end. Similarly, the labs represent different chapters of the section, the larger numbers representing topics covered later on in the semester. The labs, labeled accordingly, give an example of shorter codes that were done within a 24 hour window. By presenting programs done throughout the semester you are able to see how my coding evolved over the semester.
